# Portugal Bank Marketing Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Portugal Bank Marketing dataset, split into two parts:

### Part 1: Classification Model
In the first notebook (`Part-1_Classification_Model.ipynb`), we delve into a classification task. We explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build, and evaluate a classification model. This model is designed to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features.

### Part 2: Monthwise Market Analysis (Time Series)
In the second notebook (`Part-2_Monthwise_Market_Analysis.ipynb`), we shift our focus to time series analysis. Here, we perform a detailed monthwise analysis of market trends and patterns. By leveraging time series techniques, we uncover valuable insights into the bank's marketing performance over time.
